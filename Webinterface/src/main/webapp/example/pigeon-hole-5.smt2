; Boolean Pigeon Hole Problem in SMT format
;
; Variables p_n_i_j states pigeon i sits in hole j
;   where n is number of holes, 0<=i<=n, 1<=j<=n
; Clauses are
;   (or p_n_i_1 ... p_n_i_n)   for  0<=i<=n.
;     (every pigeon sits in a hole)
;   (or (not p_n_i_j) (not p_n_i'_j)) for 0<=i<i'<=n,1<=j<=n
;     (no two pigeons sit in the same hole
